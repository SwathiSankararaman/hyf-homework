            <div class="introduction">
                 
                        My name is Swathi. I am from India and relocated to Denmark 1 year ago. 
                        I finished my Bachelor's in India and started my carrer as a tester in an IT company called Infosys.
                        As a first step towards starting my career afresh,I attended a career course in the 
                        International house where I was introduced to <em>HACK YOUR FUTURE</em>. 
                        I want to use this good opportunity and develop my skills in becoming a developer. 
                        I am already happy that I have taken a firststep towards learning. I wish to continue with full dedication and start a new career path.
